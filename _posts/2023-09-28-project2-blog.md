![cr](https://github.com/XLin-NCSU/XLin-NCSU.github.io/assets/142820921/9a87abec-41f5-4f84-8c37-f0578be6581f)

## 1. Content of work

I pulled my clan data and all clanmates data through Clash Royale API and analyse them. 

I found that in my clan, on average, "leader" group has more trophies and more donations while three "leader" clanmates have been not seen for more than 10 days.

Moreover, I found that I am one of the best players in my clan because I have more trophies with higher winning rate. :)


## 2. What I learned

- I learned how to write functions and how to use API to pull the data in this project. 
- I searched Google for help with Token setting and heat map settings. 
- I optimized my code several times and leave comments at key positions so I can use this as a template for future similar project.
