My goal of doing EDA is to enhance the data quality and do some preliminary research work. 

After I get the data, the first thing I need to do is to check its structure: how many variables are in this data set, what is the type of each variable, what variables would be dependent variables and what variables would be independent variables.

The second step is to check whether there is missing value or outliers. Usually, I will remove records with missing values if the missing portion is very small, or use some imputation methods to impute them.

Then I would make some descriptive analysis. Five-number summary is a nice tool to show the center and spread. Boxplot or histogram is a good way to show the distribution graphically. The correlation matrix helps me to identify potential correlated numerical variables.

After doing these EDA work, I have my preliminary research report done.
