- what would you do differently?
  
  I would finish the whole project by myself because my peer was too busy with his job tasks and he submitted his part at the last moment of due that I don't have any time to check the quality of his work.
  
- what was the most difficult part for you?
  
  Using Github to do collaborate work is the most difficult part for me since I never used it before. 
  
- what are your big take-aways from this project?

  I Learned how to set up markdown automation.
